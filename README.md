# 👻 ghostnode

A prototype audit repository for the **Ghostwire Watchdog Protocol**, implemented using a secure, locally-audited React + Node.js test.

## 🔐 Purpose
This repository documents and showcases:
- A time-locked, security-conscious coding test
- Real-time Whisper logging and Watchdog auditing
- Deployment of Eternum Sentinel Protocol under non-sudo conditions

## 📦 Contents
- `Eternum_Test_Security_Audit_README_Adjusted.pdf`: Immutable proof-of-process audit
- `src/`: React + Node test logic (if applicable)
- `whisper-logs/`: Timestamped background system audit logs (see below)

## 📡 Protocols
- `ghostwire-sentinel.sh`: Background pulse logger
- `whisper-logs/`: Passive security activity trace
- Custom test logic executed with timestamp injection

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Node.js (legacy and modern)
- React
- Terminal-based nano editing
- GitHub SSH integration
- Custom Watchdog audit tooling
