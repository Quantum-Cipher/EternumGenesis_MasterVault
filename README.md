# Eternum Protocols - Core

This directory contains the core protocols for the Eternum unified operations:
- **369-coreloop.sh**: The master protocol integrating Ghostwire, Watchdog, and Whisper modules.
- **ghostwire-sentinel.sh**: Activates passive sentinel operations.
- **watchdog-audit.sh**: Runs real-time audit and monitoring.
- **whisper-logger.sh**: Logs system state and operations securely.

Each script is integral to Eternum's operational integrity and is auto-logged to Whisper for secure traceability.
