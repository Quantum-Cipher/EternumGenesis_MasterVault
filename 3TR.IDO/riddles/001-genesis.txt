# 3TR.IDO | Cipher Challenge 001: The Genesis Riddle

Welcome, Seeker.

You’ve reached the first doorway.

To unlock your Vault Share in Eternum, you must solve the following 3-layer cipher:

---

## Layer 1: Fibonacci Trigger
The 8th, 11th, and 14th digits of the Fibonacci sequence hold the keys.
Combine them into a three-digit number.

_Example:_ If the digits were 1, 3, and 4 → your answer would be `134`

Save your result — it feeds the next layer.

---

## Layer 2: Hash Invocation
Take your 3-digit number and generate a SHA-256 hash of it.

If your number was `134`, you would hash it to get:
`d97c8a1fddc1db01f29d04d9c1f67cc13e4c61b2f44391d4095f4dcfc6310387`

Use an online tool or CLI:
```bash
echo -n 134 | shasum -a 256
